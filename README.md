## Introduction

This repository has two main purposes: **learn about GIT and GitHub** while I am
building it, and **organise all my notes and exercices** about languages,
frameworks etc.

The repository will probably have unnecessary branches and commits in order to
find out how git and github works.

In order to organise all topics, there is a list of subjects, which are the
learning targets, and a list of learning materials that are the resources to
achieve the targets.

All the information about subjects is contained in markdown files in the
"subjects" directory. The reason because there are a lot of ".md" files is
because I used them to learn markdown.

The topics to learn are based in my personal preferences.
